# Mini Project: Cyber Security – Steganography

**My Streganography Project**  
This repository contains a mini project in the Cyber Security domain focused on **steganography** — the practice of hiding secret messages or data inside digital files (images, audio, etc.) without visibly changing the file. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Steganography is a technique used to conceal information within another medium so that the hidden data is not obvious to a casual observer. This project demonstrates basic steganography principles and shows how data can be embedded into and extracted from files securely.

This project is implemented as part of a mini-project for learning cybersecurity concepts.
